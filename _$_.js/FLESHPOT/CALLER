10=I know you won't want to hear this, but what about the rash of arson
that has burned through the city over the last couple days?  I'm sure
there's no Chaosmongers underpinnings to those shitty little terrorists,

11=Smartasses and kooks at every turn!  The city's on fire!  Bloody
rocks and satanic symbols in the parking lots! Somebody get the mayor on
the horn!

12=Well, if you were investigating this arson spree, wouldn't you be
looking at things like this?  Would you tell the world you were?

13=Point taken.  <James> from nowhere, you're on.
