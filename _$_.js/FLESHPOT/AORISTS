  "Aorist" is a term used to specify a certain Greek verb tense, and
those who I am tense with.

  It describes an action in the past that stopped at some point in the
past.  "I was bitching" would be aorist.

  Who is preoccupied with that which happened in the past and is
no longer happening is an Aorist.
  Who yearns for safety is an Aorist.
  Who wants everyone to get along.
  Who is not concerned with now, and cringes from when.
