Is consciousness the fourth dimension?  Probably not, but maybe
consciousness is the best way to describe the all four.  A moment of
time is a Fractal, or at least the two dimensional slice of the
three dimensional representation of that fourdimensional object.

So what would the four dimensions be?

Well, time, of course.  That's one.
And space, that's three more.  But a human mind's idea of space is
probably more, or maybe the conscious mind's idea of space is not as
defined by physical measurements, but their relationships, and their
modes.  I know that I experience and can be consious of three
dimensional space, and noticing the change along the time dimension is a
basic modal, but what about <music>?


c:\fleshpot\consciou._\paradigm
<c:\fleshpot\consciou._\music>

The paradigm of parameter passing is really not being utilized I don't
think.  It's not that the programs don't utilize them, it's just that
the programs are too large.  Windows and nanites don't jive.  One is
just a speck and one is 48 zigabytes of pristine sluggishness.  It's
like the difference between my big fucking Pontiac, and a crotch rocket.
If the task is to get me from point a to point b, which is better at
accomplishing the task.  Well given a certain environment, the crotch
rocket always wins.  A transporter might work better yet, if it was
portable or right here.  (Why is there turbolifts on the Enterprize?  So
there's a place for characters to interact.  So that everyone doesn't
get lost in the spaceless/distanceless -ness of the transporter
paradigm. Whatever.)  The point is that small and efficient will never
go away.  58 byte packets aren't big enough to make Windows dance.
An operating system that is only a pulse, pulsing as fast as it can
receive its 58 byte packets.  That's not very much room, man.  That's
not really that much for a program to do, is it?  How much code could be
involved?  256 * 58 = 14,848 on or off switches.  So maybe 14,848
programs that each control the existence of that 1/14,848th portion of
reality.  That seems more like it.  That's a lot more room to work, I'd
think.
If you liked that groove, wait.  Change <palattes> and regroove.

c:\fleshpot\consciou._\music
<c:\fleshpot\consciou._\!>

If I am at a rock concert, I can still have that four dimensional modal,
but what about the music?  What about the lights?  What about mosh
maggot sweat and stench?  Five senses.  Plus time.  Or, three
modalities, and time.  That's four.  Instead of only applying four
dimensions visually, why can't that also be represented physically?
Kinesthetically.  What's the X x Y x Z of my gut feeling about all this?
Of the feeling of my arm hair blowing in the warm summer breeze, or
Skrew on the CD player?

                                   X x Y x Z
                                     Sight
                                       |
                      X x Y x Z      --+--     X x Y x Z

c:\fleshpot\consciou._\palattes
<c:\fleshpot\consciou._\paradigm>

Why not choose your 14,848 programs as a palette.  So instead of one big
Kahuna, it's the putting together your own palette from millions of
options.  So then everyone can check out everyone else's
paradigm/palette/filter/whatever.  To think of that many programs is
difficult since I have less than a thousand, but how about some samples:

StereoVision codecs
THX Stereo

Well, before I lose it, <multitasking>.

c:\fleshpot\consciou._\multitas
<c:\fleshpot\consciou._\palattes>

Multitasking 14,848 applications is seemingly a little ridiculous, but
what if you think about something more the size of subroutines, or
primitives.  That's probably the best: primitives. . .Just took a shit,
how about <SpelZ>

c:\fleshpot\consciou._\sound
<c:\fleshpot\consciou._\music>

There are several problems with music as being dimensionable.  If music
had to be read into a three dimensional array: Music(X,Y,Z), what would
Music(1,45,3) sound like?  The array, I think, is a pointer, an
associative reference to a Meta-map or something.  If my experience of
music was the object being mapped, that would subtract a lot of
problems.  How about a guess, Music(Volume, <Direction>, Noise) then if
you apply the Klock to it, you get Music(V,D,N)/Klick, Klick being the
sample rate.  Fuck it!  Just let Rob do it!

c:\fleshpot\consciou._\spelz
<c:\fleshpot\consciou._\multitas>

One's palette of SpelZ would be limited by computing power.  If it's
going to be made of application sized SpelZ, then you best have some
serious fucking computer power.  All of the sudden there is a use for
<programmers>, and a shitload of them and as many languages as there are
SpelZ.  Or a big-kahuna environment, but why not a programming virtual
reality that is controlled by a similar number of SpelZ.  Questions, or
discussion about <interactivity>.
c:\fleshpot\consciou._\programm
<c:\fleshpot\consciou._\spelz>

A language with 14,848 primitives is a really good start.  Now, why not
give these primitives a time limit for execution, so that the output can
be synched.  In other words, the music isn't playing than the graphics
are playing.  So, on those primitives which are processor cycle cheap,
There would be a blank space of time, (That could be filled with other
enhancements in the future.  I wonder what the smallest that that

Wait a minute.  Why not a binary tree structure?

   0 or 1        input                            Talk about an expert
                  /\
   " input      1    0                                         system.
               /\   /\
   " input    1  0 1  0
            /\ /\  /\  /\
   " input 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0

So, the configuration of the primitives at nodes is of absolute
importance, as well.  The configuration would be the program or the map,
and the 58 byte packet would be the groove.  So how many grooves are
possible?  You do the math.  Primitives/SpelZ/ whatever ought to be
thought of as yes/no questions.  In other words, a primitive might be:
"Should I switch to the next screen palette?" or "Should I increment the
pitch?"  "Should I decrement the object called 'Score'"  So perhaps the
questions are front ends for the SpelZ, and of the general form,
"Proceed?(Y/N)"  The beautiful aspect, I think is the idea that one's
computer begins to be the processing engine, and is not dictated by
Klock cycle.

How about the <personality_engine> aspect of this idea.
c:\fleshpot\consciou._\personal
<c:\fleshpot\consciou._\programm>

Is it possible to get to know a person if you were allowed to ask them
14,848 yes or no questions?  "Have you ever been married?"  "Are you
angry about something?"  Etc.  With that much information, I would think
that a reasonable personality could be simulated.  So a personality
reader would interpret the answers to the questions, and output the
personality representation.  As far as the chatter thing goes, If there
is 14,848 submodalities to the speech, or 14,848 yes/no questions about
a sentence, is there enough information to decipher it for computer
consumption?

Does it contain any ignorable words?

Is it in this list?
Which half?
Which half of that?
Which half of that?
Which half of that?
etc.

In the midst of all the hype, I shall say, as if anyone would listen,
that I truly do not appreciate the value of access to huge amounts of
information.  When and if there are ever enough filters in place to make
the Internet worth my while when it comes to actually getting the
information I want, then perhaps I shall be a little more enthusiastic.
  Without people the Internet is nothing.  Without people willing to

went to that lingerie shop in
the mall, and there was this
librarian looking lady running
the place. She started klockin'
me like I didn't belong in
there, so I asked her what she
was looking at.  She told me
that the leather shop was on the
lower level of the mall.  So I
grabbed one of those frilly,
pink bras and changed into it
right there in front of her.
Then I shoved her bespectacled
pointy nose right between my
boobs, and said 'read 'em weep,
you saggy boob old lady.'  The
security guard had shown up by
then, after fighting through the
crowd that had gathered by then,
but he didn't have the balls to
do anything but stand there and
blush.  Good thing, too."
    "So you STOLE it?"
    "Hey, you listen
motherfucker. If she wouldn't
have made that smartass about
the leather, I probably would
have bought two or three.
Instead, she learned not to
shoot her fucking mouth off at
her customers, especially me.
And you, by the way, can learn
the same thing, and I won't

I don't know if anyone has assumed the role, but I will nominate myself
for resident asshole.  The following is the combination of my previous
attempts at this sort of thing, and recent research into the
possibilities. . .it should all be considered constructive.

First, the idea of an <artificial> chatter is a very good one, and I
believe a viable one with a few <reservations>.
c:\fleshpot\simulate
<c:\fleshpot\reservat>

Simulation is the name of the game here.  The "more human than human" is
a very aspirant goal, one that is probably not attainable in the hobby
setting, but that is still the holy grail.

I do not believe in Artificial Intelligence.  I do believe that
computers have very specific talents, however.  Exploiting these talents
in order to do those redundant or whatever

Invaded is probably too strong a
word, since most people enjoy their
500 channels of SNAKA TV, especially
the Eight is Enough channel, the
four Cheers channels and the
eighteen M.A.S.H. channels.

  '<Nemas._\!>' or 'TranStrands' are the strings of consciousness that we
follow through the maze of our lives.  They are usually tied to solid,
familiar landmarks, what we think we understand, and spiderweb out to
create a hopelessly tangled 'nematage;' our minds.  A nematage can be
given many analogues, like 'network', 'map', 'antenna', or 'collage',
but none of these connotates enough action or chaos.  The nematage is
a storm of frenetic growth and constant change, forever on the quest to
tie up loose ends. {Minds are embued with nematic energy, the Ghost in

Hello, all you Good People, I have something to show you.  (holds up
Rock_Hard_Dick T-shirt.)  Evil is afoot in the Peaceful Valley of the
righteous. The minds of our young people are being infected by the
disgusting chaos of sexual innuendo, passed off as an American Hero.
The precious, supple bodies of our young are being defaced by this ward
of Chaos, and the precious money that you earn every day is being sucked
from your wallets in order to satisfy the gluttonous nature of the
ChaosHead.  Only through the persistence of the Purist of Hatred can we
battle this evil fiend and the other spawn of the ChaosHead bastard.
When Love is the Answer and Peace is the Prize, Good People rise from
the. . .Wait a Goddamn minute.  Who wrote this?  There isn't any money
in this spot!  There's no 800 number, no tapes, no pamplets, no Prayer
Raffles, nothing!  The only thing that this spot does is advertize for
that dispicable Rock Hard Dick!  If that Klick Billie is behind this. . .

INTRO:
There are certain things that are impossible to subtract the hype from,
or the horror.  The bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City is
one such event.  But what happens when the hype outshines the horror?
That is what the Chaosmongers' epic slaughters have done.  We spoke with
eyewitnesses, bounty hunters, and perhaps the strangest souls, their
fans, who call themselves, among other things, Death Advocates.

TITLE> "Death Advocates:  'Chaosmongers are Heros.'"
CM1SIDEBAR "Is your city next? (MAP)"
CM2SIDEBAR "The Symbol of Chaos: What it Means"
CM3SIDEBAR "What Parents are Saying."
CM4SIDEBAR "The Industry"

BODY:
  The symbol of Chaos is everywhere--on the T-Shirts of young, militant,
youths, spray painted on the walls of the inner cities, on newscasts
(there isn't a station around that doesn't have a graphic of the symbol
to announce the Chaosmongers' latest attack).  It even showed up on the
floor of Congress during a recent Special Order.  While the FBI remains
optimistic that it knows who the Chaosmongers are, they have not been
able to stop the ruthless slaughters, to curb the intense public fear,
or to calm the rantings of doom from religious leaders.  Nor have they
dimmed the spirit of the Chaosmongers fans.
  Tommy Fredrick has been interested in the Chaosmongers ever since he
survived their attack on the Gentle Acres Mall, during their annual
sidewalk sale.  He religiously clips articles and track the attacks on a
huge map on the wall in his home office.  "I have been haunted by that
event for four and a half years now.  What haunts me is not the images
of mangled bodies or the screams, I seem to have blocked that out
somehow.  What haunts me is their voices."
  The 'voices' of the Chaosmongers are what most eye witnesses cite as
the most vivid aspect of their trauma.  "I think they're angels," he
said. The voices of the Chaosmongers have been described with words like
'demonic' and 'alien,' but usually only in conjunction with words like
'beautiful,' 'gleeful,' or 'happy.'  That is just one more enigma for
experts to sort through, and one more aspect around which hype can
build.  There are thousands of bootleg audio tapes circulating among
fans that supposedly claim to have captured the voices of Chaosmongers,
and the sounds of the slaughters. It is difficult to say whether any of
them have actually captured the voices of the Chaosmongers, but there
are at least two singles on the charts now that have integrated the
'Voices of Death,' as they're called.

c:\fleshpot\editor._\tagging
<c:\fleshpot\editor._\!>

In the short time since I spoke with WhyTdRed
about Tagging, I have done some experimenting on
my own with the Tag book that he 'Tagged me with.'

c:\fleshpot\editor._\whytdred
<c:\fleshpot\editor._\!>
  When WhyTdRed answered the door, he looked exactly like I thought he
would, a tired Rock Star.  All though his 'Rock Star Shades' had not
been bestowed upon him, he certainly acted the part.  Mecha was
definitely not ready for Good Housekeeping, and it was obvious that
Mecha was where the Fleshpot Rock Stars worked.  There was every sort of
media tacked to the wall or in piles or stacked on chairs, well
everywhere.  There were cables of every sort snaking from who knows
where to audio, video, telephone and computer equipment.  Mecha was a
wrecka, an Information Wasteland.  He called it "a model of my
Nematage."  I called it scary.  He answered the door in shorts and a
robe.
.WHY> "Oh yeah, now I know why I slept on the couch.  Welcome to Mecha,
man.  Find a place to sit, or something, I gotta get some coffee."
  I looked around, and decided that he wouldn't notice if I cleared off a
chair.  The walls were solid Fleshpot, Tags pages, etc.  It seemed like
the storeroom of some twisted future museum, than anything.  There was
one statue that was prominent, so I asked him about it.
.WHY> "My uncle gave that to me.  Milton.  After he died of AIDS."
.---> "AFTER he died?"
.WHY> "Well, yeah.  Before he got bad, he wrapped up some of his things,
and put people's names on them.  He knew that I really dug that statue,
so when I opened it, well, that was really tough, man.  Made me realize
that we hadn't had enough time, you know.  It's spooky to get messages
from beyond the grave, get Tagged by the dead."
.---> "You think about death quite a bit, don't you."
.WHY> "Yeah, kind of a personal mandate. Coffee?"
  He had been pacing around like he was looking for something, and before
I could refuse his offer for coffee, he disappeared for a minute, to
reappear with a pack of Lucky Strikes. He poured himself a cup of
coffee, sat, fired up a Lucky, and cradled his cup of coffee like it was
his heart.  Suddenly I got the feeling I was all alone.  I was prepared
for something like this, and so I tried to pretend like it was normal,
but he looked really GONE.  After about four or five minutes, he was
back.
.WHY> "That shit's too heavy right now.  I haven't had enough
coffee."
  I decided that he didn't want to tell me what that was all
about, so I asked another question.
.---> "What are you working on?"
.WHY> "Good question!  I ask myself that all the time. Well, I don't
seem to be very popular right now, since I'm either in Trance or
ranting. GadgetBrain and I are working on the interface for the Trance
Recorder when he's not working on the Goat Shredder. I,Crisis and I are
still working on Fleshpot V.II.  The Tarot aspect of the whole thing
seems to make it impossible to actually get it done.  I seem to be more
concerned about the methods that we are using to get it down, and he
keeps pumping out these heavy fucking I,Cons that completely rearrange
the whole FV2 nematage.  So I come back with some passable Trance
Shreds, we make some serious Stax, then start over because we know that
what we want will be completely too Transive for the people that we want
to get what we're trying to do.  That may sound like we're selling
people short, but it's pretty tough to compete with TV, which doesn't
take any effort.  Or Mortal Kombat which doesn't take any thought.  Did
you get some coffee, man?"
  I had realized by this time that there was probably no way that I
could have been prepared for this interview, so I accepted to give me
time to go over my notes to determine what to ask next.  He went to find
a clean mug, and I tried to get a grip.  The Trance Recorder is the
hardware/software system that dRed uses to keep track of his trances.
The Goat Shredder is GadgetBrain's chaotic interactive data base that
contains a rather large, if incomplete, Fleshpot knowledge base.
Fleshpot V.II is the paper vaporware Fleshpot sequel.  I figured that he
would bring the topic that he wanted to talk about up, so I copped out.
.---> "Who's your favorite Beatle?"
.WHY> "Ringo."
.---> "RINGO!?"
.WHY> "Yeah.  He was the only Beatle that had any sort of clue how cool
it is to be a Rock Star.  He just pops up every once in a while, wearing
his Rock Star Shades, and being a Rock Star.  He really seems to dig it.
I get sick of those Rock Stars that hate themselves, their lives, the
industry, etc. etc. etc.  Guilt isn't charming. Apologies aren't
charming.  Being humble will always be charming, though."
.---> "Are there any other 'Rock Stars' that you like?"
.WHY> "Phil Anselmo, Rob Zombie, Rush Limbaugh. . ."
.---> "RUSH LIMBAUGH!?"
.WHY> "Absolutely. He's damn good, he makes a lot of money, he does
exactly what he wants, and he doesn't apologize for his excellence, for
his Arete'"
.---> "But you don't necessarily agree with him. . ."
.WHY> "I know that you are conducting an interview and you have certain
paradigms that you employ like putting words in my mouth, and usually
that works pretty well.  I will tell you, though, that I mean exactly
what I say, and I know exactly what comes out of my mouth.  I didn't say
whether or not I agreed with him for a reason.  Don't guide the
conversation.  You are going to get to write up this article later
without my looking over your shoulder, where, you might imagine, I would
love to be.  You can edit the shit out of what I say then. But save it
for later. Cool? Alright. Now about Rush, and the reason that I didn't
go there.  That is what I call a NewlEvil Ventricle.  And my response
for NewlEvil Ventricles is 'Don't go there.'  That is because you have
found a Rant Button.  Do you wish to press it?  I'm prepared."
  He had just pressed a few buttons of my own, and since I DID get to
'edit the shit out of it' later, I PUNCHED it.
.---> "That was a slick way to say that you don't want to answer the
question.  I have plenty of tapes and plenty of pens, and you can't tell
me that my asking you whether or not you agree with Rush wouldn't be
illuminating, SOMEHOW.  So yes, I will press that 'rant' button, thank
you"
  I didn't know exactly what to think, because as I was speaking these
words, his face started to light up, and when I had finished he was
laughing.
.WHY> "You're alright, man.  We're going to have a very good time.
Prepare your pen (Deep Breath).  That question can only be answered in
certain ways.  One being, simply, 'no.'  Which is not true for me except
in an absolute sense (that being do I agree with everything, which I
wish no one could say but is probably true for most of his fans).
Another way to answer it would be like most people say, giving it a
value.  I would probably give it a value of about 87%.  Does that mean
that I'm 87% conservative?  No, unless one could call what Rush
believes as true conservatism, and I don't.  Does that mean that Rush
and I could have just as much integrity with our own beliefs and they
happen to have an 87% overlap?  That's a little closer, but the problem
is that Rush and I start at different fundamentals, and arrive at
many similar conclusions.  What both Rush and I believe in (and he can
correct me if I characterize him incorrectly) is excellence.  Every time
that the goal is excellence, he and I agree.  But, I believe that there
is also a fundamental flaw or chasm that he has to leap over all of the
time.  I don't have any problem with that as long as he understands that
it is there, which he obviously does, or he would allow philosophical
discussion about certain issues on his program that he routinely dodges.
He always has to resort to ad hominem attacks when it comes to anything
having to do with the drug war.  He knows that he will not have a
popular appeal, nor will he be able to support his views, if he opens
the arena of his program to include the Bible.  The fact is that many of
his economic views do not jive with the Bible, and his stance on drugs
is based on the fear in his own mind and in the minds of his listeners.
It's good business, though.  It is extremely entertaining to hear him
beat up on drug users on the air.
.---> "So what do drugs have to do with excellence?"
.WHY> "Nothing.  Rush knows that.  I know that.  It doesn't have
anything to do with excellence, politically.  It has to do with the
right to do certain things and the responsibility of the government to
mind their own business unless it is hurting someone else.  That's the
important thing.  Neither I nor Rush ought to have to deal with some
crackhead who wants to take OUR property to buy his next fix.  The crime
should not be doing crack (that isn't a crime, it's just fucking stupid)
it should should be stealing or robbing or whatever.

Those people latched onto Fleshpot and Tagging

description has turned into an addage of sorts,
and has taken me on a rather non-linear path to

  There are those who are in the position to produce the "next big
thing."  Is there a formula?  Well, no, fortunately.  But there
is, I believe, an Occam's Culture Razor, where most would say the
opposite.  (Occam's Razor is a rule of science that basically says that
science doesn't need eight hundred and thirty theories to explain one
phenomenon, the simplest is best.)  If a scientific approach was taken
for for those I think that there is, at least for
that which is at the cutting edge. for that, then it is changed every time a
new NBT happens.  It is difficult for me to appreciate the success of
sequels to NBT's, as they are notoriously creative cop-outs.

..\Fleshpot\TranStrand$._\(Meta_Thinking._\!
<..\Fleshpot\TranStrand$._\Tough_Shit>

I was thinking about thinking what other people were thinking and I
decided that the NO_FEAR thing had a couple different ways to think
about it.
      Firstly, most people don't give a flying fuck about thinking but
about what they think that other people are thinking, and think is
probably the wrong word.  Most people <feel>.

c:\fleshpot\nemas._\nematome
<c:\fleshpot\nemas._\!>
Nematomes are habits, talents,
abilities, beliefs, etc.  Those
things that we do or think on a
regular basis.  They consist of a
relatively large number of Nemas
that have fused themselves together
into a sort of main highway.
Nematomes are different from regular
Nemas in that they contain
Sigmatons, which are really
SubNematages.

c:\fleshpot\nemas._\!
<c:\fleshpot\agent>
Nemas are created and negotiated by
<Nematons>.  Attention is associated
with the <Alpha> Nematon.  Nemas
intersect at <Nematodes>.  New Nemas
are created by either the Alpha
Nematon, or <Beta> Nematons.
<Nematomes> are bundles of Nemas.  A
<Nematonomy> is a system used to
give names to Nemas, Nematons,
Nematodes, and Nematomes inside a
<Nematage>.
c:\fleshpot\nemas._\nematode
<c:\fleshpot\nemas._\!>
What happens when two Nemas collide?  That's a Nematode.  The study of
Nematodes is the part of Nematology that best corresponds with current
ideas about the inner workings of the mind.  Nematodes are not only the
points at which two or more Nemas intersect, but also the points at
which Nematology and other systems intersect.

c:\fleshpot\nemas._\beta
<c:\fleshpot\nemas._\!>
Beta Nematons are the grumpy drones of the system.  They are the ones
that monitor how comfortable your left foot is, destroy what you were
supposed to remember, and let you think about what you are reading
rather than burdening your Alpha with 'F-l-e-s-h-p-o-t, hmm, that spells
Fleshpot."  Betas are the most enigmatic and powerful entities, because
they are your agents.  They are (supposed to be) doing exactly what you
would do if you had the time to do everything that Betas are doing for
you at every moment.  And, when Alpha Nematon (you) sleeps, the Betas
throw the most insane parties!

c:\fleshpot\nemas._\alpha
<c:\fleshpot\nemas._\!>
The Alpha Nematon is Attention.  It can either be creating, moving
along, changing, or destroying Nemas, and is probably doing all of
these.  The modes for the Alpha Nematon include <Creative>, Enchasive,
Transitive, Destructive, Nemacidal, and others.

c:\fleshpot\nemas._\nematons
<c:\fleshpot\nemas._\!>
Nematons are what thoughts, sensations, perceptions, memories, etc. are
made of.  Your mind would be full of them if they took up space, but
they don't.  There is no physical representation of nematons, but it may
be helpful to think of them as particles, or better yet, points (as in
Euclid's "A point is that which has no part."  Def. 1, Book I _The
Elements_).  First, a discussion of the Alpha Nematon.

c:\fleshpot\nemas._\nematage
<c:\fleshpot\nemas._\!>
It may be helpful or not to use the metaphor of the mind when describing
Nematology.  But it is important in at least one situation pertaining to
Fleshpot.  That instance is Diskinetika, which is a <SuperNematage>.

c:\fleshpot\nemas._\supernem
<c:\fleshpot\nemas._\nematage>
Where human minds (with rare
exceptions) have only one Alpha
Nema, SuperNematages have many.  A
SuperNematage is the Nematage
consisting of a group of Nematages
constituent AlphaNemas, and a
SuperNematage's BetaNematons are the
AlphaNematons of constituent
Nematages.  This is where the
discussion of Betas begins, since
Betas are actually Alphas of
SubNematages.  See the diagram below
if this is confusing.

c:\fleshpot\nemas._\nematono
<c:\fleshpot\nemas._\!>
Nematonomies are what make the
concepts of Nematology USEFUL.
It may be useful to think of the
model of the mind as I have been
doing, but that is only one.
As one learns Nematology, his
ability to apply a Nematonomy will
increase, and he will receive the
understanding that accrues from
expressing a problem in those terms.

That's what Nematology is for. <!>
c:\fleshpot\nemas._\creative
<c:\fleshpot\nemas._\alpha>
The Creative mode for àN-tons are a mode which is constantly railing
agains the confines of current Nemas, in an attempt to start another, to
break out of a pattern, to make an
