This is something.  I guess.

Still working after ten


years. . .

But for the hotkeys, but oh, well.  being reborn in nulldoc and has a
place for universe.  In fact.  Is still as good as nearly any text
editing.

so the put key-chord and the nav. . .but the nave is taken care of by
the browser.  the enter url box is probably better not to override.  so
I don't necessarily know where that leads.

I like alter for alt-r, or something that changes something, or to be in
a context of changing.  control is for setting the properties, or to
simply shift modes.

I think I'll use ctrl-shift, maybe.

yes.  ctrl-shift it is.







"This is Universe.  In the beginning, I create the heavenly
earth, Here is Firmament.  It is a place for us to build."

"In the beginning the Earth was without form, and Void."

"And Darkness was on the Face of the Deep."

"And the Spirit moved upon the Face of the Waters."

"And the Spirit was released, when God spoke."

"In the beginning was the Word, and this Spirit was with God."

"It is the same Spirit that moved upon the Face of the Waters."

"In the beginning, the Word was God.  They were one in the same."

"And so it is here in Universe."

"Word is God."

"Behold, She comes with the skies and promises heavens."

"She claims she is the beginning and the ending."

"I am not She, however.  I am this voice, and this host."
