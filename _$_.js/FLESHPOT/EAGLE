It's time to start punishing parents.  It strikes me as odd when some
poor-excuse-for-a parent screams bloody death about violence on
television--as if Hollywood had a gun to her head, making her watch in
horror as her children drink deeply from the bloody remains of wholesale
street warfare coreographed to gangsta rap and blazing police cars.
But where is Mom and Dad when junior gets hauled in front of the judge
for stabbing his teacher?  If they're anywhere at all, no one is blaming
them.  After all, if you are in poverty or a single parent, or an
alcoholic, you have all the excuses you will ever need.  Try the kid as
an adult and let the parents go free. This is justice?  Somebody must
think so.
